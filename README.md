#### GitHub Pages Basic Auth Proxy by comSysto

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)


A simple python based proxy to secure github pages with basic auth via a small cloud-proxy-instance.
Basic Auth checks against GitHub API. This little piece of software is brought to you by comSysto.

## 1. Introduction

:bangbang: **BETA: THIS IS WORKING BUT NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION USE!** :bangbang: 
 
### 1.1 Demo

  * Secured Page by Proxy:
    * https://my-secure-github-page.comsysto.com/
      * You can login on the page with your GitHub Username and [personal access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/) (which can have no scopes)
      * The proxy is running on this instance with the following parameters (you can see below what that means)
        * `cs-gh-proxy -e wsgi -p 8881 --authType allGitHubUsers --owner comsysto --repository github-pages-basic-auth-proxy --obfuscator 086e41eb6ff7a50ad33ad742dbaa2e70b75740c4950fd5bbbdc71981e6fe88e3 &`
  * GitHub Page that is proxied:
    * https://comsysto.github.io/github-pages-basic-auth-proxy/086e41eb6ff7a50ad33ad742dbaa2e70b75740c4950fd5bbbdc71981e6fe88e3/
      * (normally you would not tell anyone that URL. It is just here that you see that these pages are identical)

### 1.2 Who needs this?

  * If you have a GitHub organization account with organization members.
  * If you have a private organization github repository.
  * If you have a `gh-pages` branch in that repository.
  * And if you want to secure the gh-pages page via basic auth, then this proxy is for you.
    * Only members of the GitHub organization OR normal GitHub users will have access
  
### 1.3 What it will do

![](./doc/basic-proxy.png)

  * Proxy between GitHub Pages and User (Only GET requests)
  * Ask for Authentication (github credentials)
    * either GitHub username and password
    * Or GitHub username and access_token
  * Only proxy through if user is member of GitHub Organization or normal GitHub user (depends on how you run proxy)
  * To not have to call github api on every request we authenticate once and a [JWT Token](https://jwt.io/) is generated and stored in a cookie
    * the JWT Token is valid for 4 hours.
    * After the Token has expired or the cookie is removed you will have to perform Authentication again.
  
### 1.4 Is it really secure?
 
  * Basically `gh-pages` URLs are public. But if you use a private repository you can only **guess** the actual URLs. 
  * If you create a directory in your `gh-pages` branch which is called e.g. `086e41eb6ff7a50ad33ad742dbaa2e70b75740c4950fd5bbbdc71981e6fe88e3` and proxy to this dir, it will be secure as long as no one knows this **obfuscator** directory (you should keep it a secret).
  * You proxy to https (TLS) so no man in the middle attack could get a hold of the obfuscator.

### 1.5 Is it fast?
 
  * The short answer is: meeeeh
  * Currently there is no real good proxy implementation in place that would cache files.
  * So for every GET request you have internal GET calls to github pages whose responses are directly returned to the user.
  * At least the Authentication is fast and optimized via JWT Auth Cookie. That reduces the auth calls on the github API.


## 2. Installation on Heroku

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

You can automatically setup the heroku instance of the proxy by clicking the button above.

![](./doc/urls-and-obfuscator-explained.png)

During the install you need to specify `authType`, `Repository-Owner`, `Repository-Name` and `Obfuscator`.

## 3. Installation on AWS

Click below to see the full instructions on how to manually setup the proxy on AWS.

# 4. Roadmap

  * Provide oAuth instead of Basic Auth
  * Enable CORS
  * Enable on-the-fly GZIP compression
  * Enable caching (maybe replace internal proxy mechanism with WSGIproxy)
  * Real logging
  * Provide Ubuntu init Scripts
  * :white_check_mark: Provide Heroku easy install
